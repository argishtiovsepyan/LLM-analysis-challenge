# LLM Analysis Challenge

## Overview

This Jupyter notebook presents a comprehensive analysis of Language Learning Models (LLM) completions. The focus is on evaluating the completions using two different reward models: `rlhf_reward_model` and `reciprocate_reward_model`. The analysis aims to uncover insights into how these models score LLM completions and the implications of these scores.

## Data Description

The dataset includes:
- **Prompts:** Questions or tasks sent to various servers.
- **Completions:** Responses from servers, evaluated by the reward models.
- **Reward Models:** 
  - `rlhf_reward_model`: [OpenAssistant/reward-model-deberta-v3-large-v2](https://huggingface.co/OpenAssistant/reward-model-deberta-v3-large-v2)
  - `reciprocate_reward_model`: [reciprocate/gpt-j_rm_format-oa](https://huggingface.co/reciprocate/gpt-j_rm_format-oa)

## Analysis Breakdown

1. **Data Exploration:** Initial exploration of the dataset, focusing on the structure and distribution of prompts and completions.
2. **Reward Model Evaluation:** In-depth analysis of how the `rlhf_reward_model` and `reciprocate_reward_model` score the LLM completions.
3. **Comparative Analysis:** A comparison between the two models in terms of scoring patterns and biases.

## Key Insights

- Detailed evaluation of LLM completions and their scoring by two distinct reward models.
- Identification of patterns and potential biases in model scoring.
- Implications of these findings for the development and refinement of reward models in LLM applications.
